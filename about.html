    <p>Grove Above was conceptualized in 2019 by ceramic artist Haley B. Schweizer. 
    When she moved to tropical Florida and bought her first home, she quickly fell in love with gardening and houseplants. 
    Haley had been working as a figure-sculptor and decorating her pieces with intricate floral designs referential to Greek mythology.
    Now surrounded by amazing plants, she had the vision to strip away those designs and elevate them, illuminated in the sky, bringing botanical sculpture into the home.

    Grove Above is jubilant, lavish, and embraces nature.

    <p id="center">Enjoy your space thoroughly, decorate it devilishly, and remind yourself to step outside for inspiration and awe.
    Create your own sanctuary. Create your own grove.
